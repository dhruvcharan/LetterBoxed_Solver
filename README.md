# Daily NYTimes Letterboxd and SpellBee Solver

This repository contains a Python-based solver for the daily NYTimes Letterboxd and SpellBee puzzles.

I plan on converting this into a Django Based WebApp that fetches the current puzzles and shows a more interactive UI but the current implementation is the barebones CLI based demo


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (version specified in `.python-version`)
- Required Python packages (specified in `pyproject.toml`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Letterboxdsolver-django.git
    cd Letterboxdsolver-django
    ```

2. Install the required packages:

    ```sh
    pip install -r pyproject.toml
    ```

### Usage

Run `main.py` to solve the daily NYTimes Letterboxd and SpellBee puzzles. The CLI will prompt you for the type of puzzle and the necessary inputs.

```sh
python [main.py]
```
